# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Project
Getting and Cleaning Data Project


Create an R script called run_analysis.R that does the following:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject

Steps to follow for this course project:
----------------------------------------------------
Download the data source into a folder on your local drive. It will be downloaded in UCI HAR Dataset folder.
Set the parent folder as your working directory using setwd() function in RStudio.
Save run_analysis.R in the parent folder of UCI HAR Dataset
Run the source, run_analysis.R, which will generate a file, tidy_data.txt in the working directory.
